Rules of Reversi ----

You must place one tile each turn in a way that it will flip
one or more of your opponents tiles.
Your opponent's tiles can only be flipped if they are
surrounded by your tiles.
The goal of the game is to get the most tiles of your colour 
on the board. 
If you have no possible moves, your turn will be skipped.
The gray tiles are a guide to show your possible moves.
